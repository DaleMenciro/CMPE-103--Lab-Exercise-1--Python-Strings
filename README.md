# Laboratory Exercise 1

Laboratory Exercise 1 is composed of 2 problems: Problem 2- Decryption and Problem 3- The Vigenère Cipher

## Problem 2: Decryption

### Parameters

- Python Script that will accept a string as encrypted text
- Program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:
'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !


## Problem 3: The Vigenère Cipher
### Parameter

- Your key is a keyword, which you then translate into corresponding letter values 0 – 25. Then, to encrypt, write your message on one row (letters 0 – 25), and repeatedly write the keyword below it, adding each column, taking the result mod 26. These resultant numbers are the ciphertext.
